Miniconda/Anaconda is recommended for managing the Python environment. 
This was tested with Python 3.11. But it should work with Python 3.8+.

Install the required packages by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, to install netron_export:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/raphael-prevost/netron-export
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```
